		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>Here is a short bio about myself. I am originally from Atlanta, Georgia and have been living in Austin, Texas for almost four years. My whole family still lives in Atlanta. I moved here because I was bored and wanted to try something new. I have been working at eBay for a little over two years on a global operations team. I got to travel to Shanghai, China last year to meet my boss and fellow teammates. It was really fun!<br>
		When I am not working I like to go out with friends and be kinda crazy, or find something nice to do outside, or try new restaurants around the city. Sometimes I like to go dancing. I prefer to use a picture of Homer Simpson as my profile picture because he is more photogenic.</p>
